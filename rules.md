# War Rules

## Summary
Deal out all the card face down to everyone playing. Everyone flips 1 card over and puts it in the middle. Whoever has the highest card wins all the cards in the middle. If any numbers match, the matching players flip 4 more cards face down and 1 card face up. Whoever has the highest face-up card wins all the cards in the middle.

The ranking for cards in War from highest to lowest is A K Q J T (10) 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Nothing beats an Ace and a 2 beats nothing.[

### Step 1
Shuffle the deck of cards.

### Step 2
Deal the cards. Deal back and forth between you and your opponent until the two of you have the same number of cards. You should have 26 cards each.

### Step 3
Each player will flip a card at the same time.

### Step 4
Compare your cards to see which is higher. The player with the higher card wins the round and collects both cards to add to their hand.

### Step 5
Go to 'War' when the cards you flip are the same card. However, it doesn't matter the suit of the card; its value of the card does matter. Two jacks can set up a War, or two or more tens can setup a war or even two aces can setup a war. For example, you both flip your cards and each of you flips over a '6'. Now is the time to go to war. To go to war, each player must place three more cards face-down on the table. Flip over a fourth card as you would flip a card when not at 'War'. Whoever has the higher fourth card is the person who takes all 10 cards from the round.

If the 4th card is the same, go to 'War' again.

If a player doesn't have enough cards to place three cards down and play one, they lose.

### Step 6
When a player runs out of cards in their hand, they should shuffle the cards that they have collected and add them to the bottom of their deck.

### Step 7
The game ends when one player has all the cards.
